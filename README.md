Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engeneering principles, methods, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Importance of software Engineering in the technology industry is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, entertainment, commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The advent of structured programming-Edsger advocated for structured programming which led to better coding practices reducing the resilianceon unstructured code. Languages like C promoted modular programming , improving readability and maintainability
Development of programming languages-languages such as LISP abstracted away hardware-specific instructions, improving productivity and reducing erros
The rise of agile methodologies-this emphasizrd individuals and interactions over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to changes over following a plan

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-this is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-this is crestin high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation-this is the writing of code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-developers conduct various tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-the software is released to users or customers.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases for example, requirement, design, implementation, testing and then deployment while Agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approachfocused flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes for example, in startups and mobile apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing for example, visual studio and Eclipse.
Version control systems helps a developer to track changes to source code and coordinate among team members for example, subversion and Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include:
Tight deadline-pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result to rushed development and compromised quality
Changing requirements-requiremens may change during development cycle leading to project delay
Technical debt-accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions which can increase maintenance cost
Strategies to overcome the challenges include:
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassesment of project goals and timelines
Agile methodologies
Effective communication.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing-includes testing individual components or modules of a software
Integration testing-is testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing-this is testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing-is the testing of the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Their importance in software  quality assurance they help identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promp engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
Its importance is that it helps improve interactions between humans and AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
